## GIFtastic

Sometimes a certain situation brings out a reaction from you that you cannot express from words alone.
GIFtastic is a web application that allows you to search for GIFs and save them for later with the help of the GIPHY API and localStorage.

### Project's Uses

Upon clicking a certain emotion (whether it is 'Happy', 'Sad', 'Excited', or 'In Love'), it brings up multiple GIFs that the user is able to play and watch.
There is an option to always view more GIFs of that certain emotion as well.

If the user feels like they enjoy a certain GIF, they are able to visit the link to the GIF, save it, or favorite it.

If the user has a certain emotion that they want to express and search through, they can add that emotion as a button of their own.
